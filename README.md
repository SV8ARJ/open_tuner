SV8ARJ Tests :
Minor UI enhancments. Only for PicoTunner (maybe Mini)

- Side Bar may be hidden/shown
- Frequency band may be  hidden/shown/change size
- Information overlay on the video players (Station ID, Receiver and Stream data, sound active)
- Double clicks change sizes of things (look for tooltips)
- Sound may be muted/umnmuted from player (not synced with control panel yet)
